# 🚀 Quick Start: Production Security Migration

**For 100+ users in production** - This guide gets you migrated safely in under 5 minutes.

## ⚡ TL;DR - Quick Commands

```bash
# 1. Check current status
npm run migrate:security:check

# 2. Run the migration (safe, zero-downtime)
npm run migrate:security

# 3. Verify success
npm run migrate:security:check
```

**OR use the automated script:**

```bash
# One-command deployment
./deploy-security-update.sh
```

## 🎯 What This Migration Does

✅ **Adds security fields to existing users**  
✅ **Zero downtime** - users stay logged in  
✅ **Safe defaults** - no data loss  
✅ **Automatic backup** - rollback ready  
✅ **Batch processing** - no performance impact  

## 📋 Pre-Flight Checklist (2 minutes)

### 1. **Backup Database** (Recommended)
```bash
# If you have mongodump installed
mongodump --uri="your-mongodb-uri" --out=./backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### 2. **Verify Environment Variables**
```bash
# Check these are set in your .env
echo $MONGODB_URI
echo $ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET  
echo $REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET
```

### 3. **Test in Staging** (If Available)
```bash
# Run on staging first
npm run migrate:security:check
npm run migrate:security
```

## 🚀 Migration Process (3 minutes)

### Option A: Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the complete deployment process
./deploy-security-update.sh

# Follow the prompts - it will:
# ✅ Check environment
# ✅ Create backup  
# ✅ Run migration
# ✅ Validate results
# ✅ Restart app (if using PM2)
```

### Option B: Manual Steps
```bash
# Step 1: Check current state
npm run migrate:security:check

# Step 2: Run migration
npm run migrate:security

# Step 3: Verify success
npm run migrate:security:check

# Step 4: Restart your app
pm2 restart all  # or your restart command
```

## 📊 Expected Output

**Before Migration:**
```
📊 Total users in database: 150
📈 Users with new security fields: 0
📉 Users without new security fields: 150
```

**During Migration:**
```
🔄 Processing batch: 1 to 50
✅ Successfully migrated 50 users
🔄 Processing batch: 51 to 100  
✅ Successfully migrated 50 users
🔄 Processing batch: 101 to 150
✅ Successfully migrated 50 users
✅ Migration completed! Total users migrated: 150
```

**After Migration:**
```
📊 Total users in database: 150
📈 Users with new security fields: 150
📉 Users without new security fields: 0
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Resumable**: Can be run multiple times safely
- **Batch Processing**: Handles large user bases efficiently  
- **Zero Downtime**: Users stay logged in during migration
- **Automatic Backup**: Creates backup before starting
- **Rollback Ready**: Can undo if needed

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### **Migration Fails?**
```bash
# Re-run the migration (it's safe)
npm run migrate:security

# Or rollback if needed
npm run migrate:security:rollback
```

### **App Won't Start?**
```bash
# Check environment variables
cat .env | grep -E "(MONGODB_URI|ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET|REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET)"

# Check logs for errors
tail -f your-app-logs.log
```

### **Users Can't Login?**
```bash
# Verify migration completed
npm run migrate:security:check

# Check security status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/security/status
```

## 🎉 After Migration

**New Security Features Active:**
- 🚫 Token blacklisting for secure logout
- 📊 Session tracking and monitoring
- 🛡️ Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- 🍪 Secure cookie handling

**Monitor Your App:**
```bash
# Watch for auth-related logs
tail -f your-app-logs.log | grep -E "(🔐|🚨|❌)"

# Check security status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/security/status
```
